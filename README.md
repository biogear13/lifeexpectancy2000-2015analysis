Introduction

Welcome to the Life Expectancy Analysis repository! This project focuses on exploring and analyzing life expectancy at birth and its relationship with various health and socioeconomic indicators. Life expectancy is a critical measure that reflects the length of a newborn's life and provides insights into the overall health and well-being of a population. By understanding the factors that influence life expectancy, we can gain valuable insights into healthcare effectiveness, social conditions, and the need for interventions in different countries.
Project Overview

This project aims to investigate changes in average life expectancy from the year 2000 to 2015 across different country income categories. Additionally, we explore the correlation between life expectancy and various health and socioeconomic indicators to identify priority countries that require assistance in improving their health systems. The analysis includes data visualizations to effectively communicate the findings and provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

    Python: Used for data cleaning and preparation.
    Tableau: Employed to create interactive and informative data visualizations.

Data Collection and Preparation

The data used for this analysis was obtained from the Kaggle dataset titled "Life Expectancy (WHO)." You can find the dataset here. Additionally, a country classification document from the United Nations was utilized to categorize countries based on their income levels. The UN document can be accessed here.
Results and Achievements

The analysis conducted in this project yielded several key findings and achievements:

    Globally, life expectancy at birth increased from an average of 66 years in 2000 to 71 years in 2015.
    Low-income countries experienced the most significant increase in life expectancy, with a rise of 8 years from 54 years.
    Lower middle-income countries saw a 5-year increase, while upper middle and high-income countries each had a 4-year increase.
    The analysis examined nine indicators associated with life expectancy, highlighting their impact on the metric.
    Various indicators, such as adult deaths, under-five deaths, infant deaths, HIV/AIDS deaths, and adolescent thinness, showed a negative correlation with life expectancy, while indicators like polio vaccinations, health expenditure, years in schooling, and income composition exhibited a positive correlation.
    Detailed visualizations were created to showcase the findings, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the trends and patterns observed.

Future Scope

This project has significant implications for the healthcare and public health domains. The insights gained from this analysis can inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and international organizations in developing targeted strategies and interventions to improve health outcomes and quality of life across different countries and income categories.

In terms of future enhancements and applications, the following possibilities can be explored:

    Further analysis to investigate the impact of specific health interventions on life expectancy.
    Incorporation of more recent data to provide up-to-date insights into global health trends.
    Expansion of the analysis to include additional indicators and regions for a more comprehensive understanding.

Conclusion

Understanding life expectancy at birth is crucial for assessing the health and well-being of populations worldwide. Through this project, we have explored changes in life expectancy from 2000 to 2015 and examined its relationship with various health and socioeconomic indicators. The findings highlight both progress made and challenges that persist in different countries and income categories.
